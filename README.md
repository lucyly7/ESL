## Hello.

The included PDFs include snippets of my R and Python code from computing exercises obtained from the textbook "Elements of Statistical Learning" by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman. 
Each document includes my responses to said exercises and comments on my code for clarification.
This repository is intended to be a record of my progress through the textbook and a practical visual demonstration of the concepts I've learned or reviewed from the textbook.
